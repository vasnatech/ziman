# Principles

Part of the [design journal](README.md) -- see its "How to read this journal" for what a dated entry means.

## Principles

1. **No hidden control flow.** What a line does must be derivable from that
   line plus its declared types and imports — never from action-at-a-distance
   (no operator overloading, no implicit conversions, no macros that rewrite
   meaning invisibly).
2. **One way to do a thing.** No syntactic synonyms. One loop construct per
   shape of loop, one function-definition form, one string-formatting
   mechanism. Every accreted "second way" in an existing language is a
   documented source of both human bugs and LLM training-distribution
   ambiguity — Ziman doesn't add a second way without removing the first.
3. **Explicit over implicit.** Mutability, type coercion, and effects are
   opt-in and visible at the declaration site, not inferred from usage.
4. **No semantic whitespace.** Blocks are delimited by `{}`, never by
   indentation. Indentation-as-syntax (Python) is a disproportionate source
   of LLM diff/generation errors — a model that drops or adds one space
   silently changes program structure. Statement boundaries are newlines,
   which is unambiguous (see SYNTAX.md) and not the same failure mode.
5. **Errors are data, not just prose.** The compiler's diagnostics are
   structured (machine-parseable) and render as clear text for humans from
   the same underlying record. This lets an LLM (or a human's editor)
   consume a compile error programmatically without scraping a string.
   (Implemented as `ziman --json`: one JSON object per error, rendered
   from the same record as the text form -- see the "`--check` and
   `--json`" entry below.)
6. **Small orthogonal core.** Prefer a handful of composable constructs over
   many special-cased ones. Anything not in the core is a library function,
   not new syntax.
